# Product-site-sample

Website sample for web hosting company. The company is fake, I made it up from my mind.

I tried making the website resposive and at the same time look the same time at all devices. Thus, i removed the <b>meta</b> tag that includes the initial-scale=1.0.

<ul><h3>Includes:</h3>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>nice graphics</li>
<li>Hover interactions</li>
<li>Responsive</li>
</ul>
